        <p>I am a B.A.S. in computer information systems technology student at Eastern Florida State College. I graduated with my A.S. in computer programming and analysis in December 2020. I have an A.S. in culinary arts from Le Cordon Bleu College for Culinary Arts Orlando. I have worked in numerous kitchens including Mythos and Kohola in Universal Studios Florida (evening helping open Volcano Bay), and The Greenbrier Resort. In October 2018, a virus attacked my nervous system that made it difficult to stand and walk. I stuggled to recover and slowly got worse. In September 2019, my wife and I left the Greenbrier and moved back to Florida for me to rest and recover, and to start learning to program.</p>
